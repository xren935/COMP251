# Algorithms and Data Structures (COMP251 at McGill University)
This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments of COMP251(Fall 2019). \
I enjoyed the course and learned a lot. Hope you like it too! \
**ALL questions and starter code are provided by the awesome course instructors, so all credits go to them!** \
*A special thanks to Virna Xi for helping me survive the Montr√©al winter by discussing the proofs with me*
